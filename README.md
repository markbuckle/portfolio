# My Portfolio

I built my personal portfolio with the following tools:

- Front-end: React
- CSS framework: React-bootstrap
- CSS animations library: Animate.css

I used the [React App docs ](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) and [Animate CSS docs](https://animate.style/) as guides:

My portfolio includes the following tabs/sections:
- sidebar as a navigation bar
- banner / home screen
- about me
- skills
- projects
- resume
- let's connect
- footer
